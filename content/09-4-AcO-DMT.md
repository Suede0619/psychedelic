</div>
## Overview
*4-AcO-DMT is a synthetic psychedelic that is chemically related to psilocybin and converts to psilocin in the body. Often called "synthetic mushrooms," it produces effects very similar to psilocybin mushrooms but with more predictable dosing and purity.*

- **Chemical Name**: 4-Acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
- **Common Names**: 4-AcO-DMT, Psilacetin, O-Acetylpsilocin, Synthetic Shrooms
- **Classification**: Synthetic Tryptamine Psychedelic
- **Duration**: 4-8 hours
- **Onset**: 15-45 minutes
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-4 hours
- **Origin**: Synthetic (developed by Albert Hofmann)
- **Legal Status**: Unscheduled in many places, legal grey area

## Experience
*4-AcO-DMT produces experiences nearly identical to psilocybin mushrooms, including visual effects, introspection, and emotional processing. Users often report it as indistinguishable from a mushroom experience with the benefit of precise dosing.*
