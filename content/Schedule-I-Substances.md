# Schedule I Substances

*Psychedelics classified as Schedule I controlled substances with the most restrictive legal status*

## Overview

Schedule I is the most restrictive category of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act, reserved for drugs with high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Most classic psychedelics fall into this category, creating significant legal barriers despite growing therapeutic research.

## Schedule I Classification Criteria

### Legal Requirements for Schedule I
**Three Criteria Must Be Met:**
1. **High Potential for Abuse**: Likelihood of non-medical use
2. **No Currently Accepted Medical Use**: Lack of FDA-approved medical applications
3. **Lack of Accepted Safety**: Insufficient evidence of safety under medical supervision

### Penalties for Schedule I Violations
**Federal Criminal Penalties:**
- Possession: Up to 1 year prison, $1,000+ fine (first offense)
- Distribution: 5-40 years prison, up to $5 million fine
- Manufacturing: 10 years to life, up to $10 million fine
