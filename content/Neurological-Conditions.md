# Neurological Conditions

*Psychedelic treatments for neurological disorders including headaches, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain injuries*

## Overview

Psychedelic substances show remarkable promise for treating various neurological conditions, with cluster headaches leading the research. These applications often involve sub-psychedelic doses and focus on neuroplasticity enhancement, neuroprotection, and specific neurological symptom relief.

## Cluster Headache Treatment

### Clinical Characteristics
**Cluster Headache Syndrome:**
- Excruciating unilateral head pain
- Attacks occur in clusters (weeks to months)
- Accompanied by autonomic symptoms
- Highly debilitating and treatment-resistant
- Often called "suicide headaches" due to severity

### Treatment Mechanisms
**Neurobiological Effects:**
- Trigeminal-vascular system modulation
- Hypothalamic circadian rhythm regulation
- Serotonin receptor system effects
- Vascular tone and inflammation reduction
- Neuroplasticity and pain pathway modification

### Clinical Protocols

**Psilocybin Protocol for Cluster Headaches:**
- **Dosing**: 0.1-2.0g dried mushrooms or equivalent
- **Frequency**: Every 5 days during cluster period
- **Duration**: Treatment throughout cluster cycle
- **Setting**: Home-based with medical oversight
- **Monitoring**: Headache diary and frequency tracking

**Treatment Outcomes:**
- 80-100% of patients report significant improvement
- Dramatic reduction in headache frequency
- Decreased intensity of breakthrough headaches
- Extended remission periods
- Reduced need for conventional medications

## Migraine Prevention

### Chronic Migraine Applications
**Target Population:**
- Chronic migraine sufferers (15+ headache days/month)
- Treatment-resistant cases
- Patients with medication overuse
- Those seeking non-pharmaceutical approaches

### Research Protocols
**Psilocybin for Migraine Prevention:**
- Monthly high-dose sessions
- Sub-psychedelic maintenance dosing
- Integration with lifestyle modifications
- Comprehensive headache tracking
- Combination with behavioral therapies

**Preliminary Outcomes:**
- Significant reduction in monthly migraine days
- Decreased use of rescue medications
- Improved quality of life measures
- Enhanced stress management abilities
- Better sleep patterns
