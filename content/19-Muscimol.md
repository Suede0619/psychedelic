## Overview
*Muscimol is the primary psychoactive compound found in Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) mushrooms. Unlike psilocybin, muscimol acts on GABA receptors, producing dream-like states, altered perception, and unique experiences that differ significantly from classical psychedelics.*

- **Chemical Name**: 3-Hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole (from Amanita muscaria)
- **Common Names**: Amanita muscaria, Fly Agaric, Fly Amanita, Red and White Mushroom
- **Classification**: GABAergic Psychoactive (GABA-A receptor agonist)
- **Duration**: 4-10 hours
- **Onset**: 30-120 minutes
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-6 hours
- **Origin**: Natural (Amanita muscaria mushrooms)
- **Legal Status**: Legal in most jurisdictions

## Experience
*Muscimol produces dream-like, dissociative experiences with altered perception of size, time, and reality. Effects can include sedation, vivid dreams, out-of-body experiences, and unique consciousness alterations distinct from classical psychedelics.*

### Set and Setting Considerations
- Safe, comfortable environment essential due to sedating effects
- Indoor setting preferred due to potential coordination issues
- Experienced guide beneficial for first experiences
- Prepare for possible sleep or deep relaxation periods

### Typical Experience Phases
- **Onset** (30-120 minutes): Initial relaxation, altered perception beginning
- **Peak** (2-4 hours): Full effects, dream-like states, possible sedation
- **Plateau** (1-3 hours): Sustained altered consciousness
- **Come Down** (2-6 hours): Gradual return with possible lingering effects
