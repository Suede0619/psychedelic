## Overview
*1P-LSD is a psychedelic lysergamide that acts as a prodrug to LSD, producing nearly identical effects. Often used as a legal alternative to LSD, it's believed to convert to LSD in the body, making it functionally equivalent to LSD in terms of experience and effects.*

- **Chemical Name**: 1-Propionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide
- **Common Names**: 1P-LSD, 1-Propionyl-LSD
- **Classification**: Lysergamide Psychedelic (LSD prodrug, 5-HT2A receptor agonist)
- **Duration**: 8-12 hours
- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes
- **Peak**: 3-5 hours
- **Come Down**: 4-8 hours
- **Origin**: Synthetic (LSD analogue)
- **Legal Status**: Legal grey area in many jurisdictions

## Experience
*1P-LSD produces experiences virtually identical to LSD, including visual effects, introspection, and consciousness alteration. Users report no distinguishable difference from LSD in terms of effects, making it a popular legal alternative where available.*
