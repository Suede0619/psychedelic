# Entactogens (Empathogens)

*Substances that enhance empathy, emotional connection, and interpersonal bonding*

## Overview

Entactogens, also known as empathogens, are a class of psychoactive substances that produce feelings of emotional openness, empathy, and connection with others. Unlike classic psychedelics, they primarily work through monoamine release rather than serotonin receptor agonism, creating unique therapeutic opportunities for trauma processing and relationship healing.
