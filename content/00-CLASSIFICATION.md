# Psychedelic Classifications

*A comprehensive guide to psychedelic substance classifications based on chemical structure, mechanism of action, and pharmacological properties*

## Overview

Psychedelics are classified into several major categories based on their chemical structure, receptor mechanisms, and subjective effects. Understanding these classifications helps predict effects, safety profiles, and therapeutic applications.

---

## [[Classic-Psychedelics]]

*Serotonergic compounds that primarily activate 5-HT2A receptors*

Primary mechanism: 5-HT2A receptor agonism leading to altered consciousness and perception. These substances are characterized by their ability to produce visual and auditory hallucinations, spiritual experiences, and profound shifts in awareness.

**Key Categories:**
- Tryptamines (psilocybin, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT)
- Lysergamides (LSD, LSA, analogs)  
- Phenethylamines (mescaline, 2C compounds)

---

## [[Plant-Medicines]]

*Traditional sacred medicines with thousands of years of use*

Natural psychoactive plants used in traditional spiritual and healing practices. These substances are deeply embedded in indigenous cultures and carry profound cultural, spiritual, and healing significance.

**Regional Classifications:**
- Amazonian medicines (ayahuasca, changa)
- African medicines (iboga, traditional healing)
- North American medicines (peyote, San Pedro)

---

## [[Entactogens]]

*Empathy and connection-enhancing compounds*

Substances that enhance empathy, emotional connection, and interpersonal bonding through monoamine release rather than serotonin receptor agonism.

**Primary Applications:**
- PTSD treatment (MDMA breakthrough therapy)
- Couples and relationship therapy
- Social anxiety disorders
- Trauma processing and integration

---

## [[Dissociatives]]

*Consciousness-separating anesthetic compounds*

Substances that cause disconnection between mind and body through NMDA receptor antagonism, creating unique altered states of consciousness.

**Medical Applications:**
- Depression treatment (ketamine approved)
- Chronic pain management
- Anesthesia and medical procedures
- Addiction treatment research

---

## [[Mild-Psychedelics]]

*Gentler consciousness-altering substances*

Substances that produce subtle to moderate alterations in consciousness with broader accessibility and cultural acceptance.

**Primary Applications:**
- Therapeutic integration support
- Microdosing protocols
- Bridge to classical psychedelics
- Alternative approaches for sensitive populations

---

## [[Research-Chemicals]]

*Novel synthetic compounds with limited research*

Synthetic psychoactive substances designed to mimic established psychedelics while often existing in legal grey areas, with limited safety data and unknown long-term effects.

**High Risk Factors:**
- Unknown safety profiles
- Variable quality control
- Legal uncertainties
- Limited medical literature

---

## [[Dangerous-Substances]]

*Educational information only - extreme caution advised*

Substances with unpredictable, often dangerous effects that have caused multiple deaths and severe injuries. This information is provided for harm reduction and safety awareness.

## Mechanism of Action Classifications

### 5-HT2A Agonists (Classic Psychedelics)
- Primary serotonin receptor activation
- Visual and auditory hallucinations
- Altered perception of time and space
- Spiritual/mystical experiences

### Monoamine Releasers (Entactogens)
- Serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine release
- Enhanced empathy and emotional connection
- Reduced fear and anxiety
- Increased sociability

### NMDA Antagonists (Dissociatives)
- Glutamate system blockade
- Disconnection from body and environment
- Anesthetic and analgesic effects
- Altered sense of identity

### GABAergic (Depressant Psychedelics)
- GABA receptor activation
- Sedating and dream-like effects
- Different from serotonergic psychedelics

### Anticholinergic (Deliriants)
- Acetylcholine blockade
- Realistic hallucinations and delirium
- High danger and unpredictability

---

## Safety Classification

### Relatively Safe (With Proper Precautions)
- Classic psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline)
- Entactogens (MDMA when pure and tested)
- Cannabis

### Moderate Risk
- Dissociatives (ketamine, nitrous oxide)
- Plant medicines (require traditional guidance)
- Research chemicals (unknown long-term effects)

### High Risk/Dangerous
- NBOMe compounds
- PCP and analogs
- Datura and anticholinergics
- Adultered/untested substances
