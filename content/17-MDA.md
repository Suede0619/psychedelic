## Overview
*MDA is a psychedelic amphetamine that combines empathogenic effects with visual psychedelic properties. Often called the "love drug," it predates MDMA and offers a more psychedelic experience with enhanced visual effects and introspective qualities.*

- **Chemical Name**: 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine
- **Common Names**: MDA, Sally, Love Drug, Tenamfetamine
- **Classification**: Empathogenic Psychedelic (Serotonin-dopamine-norepinephrine releaser)
- **Duration**: 6-10 hours
- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-6 hours
- **Origin**: Synthetic (developed early 1900s)
- **Legal Status**: Schedule I in most countries

## Experience
*MDA provides a unique combination of MDMA-like empathy and love with LSD-like visual effects and introspection. Users often report deeper, more psychedelic experiences than MDMA with enhanced emotional processing and visual phenomena.*
