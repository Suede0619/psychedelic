# Tryptamines

*Indole ring system psychedelics with ethylamine side chain*

## Overview

Tryptamines are a class of psychedelic compounds characterized by an indole ring system with an ethylamine side chain. They are among the most widely researched and therapeutically promising psychedelics, with psilocybin leading FDA approval efforts. Tryptamines are known for producing introspective experiences, spiritual insights, and therapeutic breakthroughs.

- 5-HT2C receptor activity (mood effects)
- 5-HT1A receptor interactions (anxiolytic effects)
- Dopamine D2 receptor affinity (some compounds)
- Sigma-1 receptor interactions (neuroplastic effects)

### Metabolism and Duration
**Metabolic Pathways:**
- Monoamine oxidase (MAO) metabolism
- First-pass hepatic metabolism (oral administration)
- Phase I and II hepatic metabolism
- Renal elimination of metabolites
- Individual variation in metabolism rates

**Duration Factors:**
- Route of administration
- Individual metabolism rates
