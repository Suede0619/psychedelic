## Overview
*PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that produces powerful dissociative effects and altered states of consciousness. Originally developed as an anesthetic, it's known for unpredictable and potentially dangerous effects including dissociation, anesthesia, and possible aggressive behavior.*

- **Chemical Name**: 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine
- **Common Names**: PCP, Angel Dust, Phencyclidine, Peace Pill, Hog
- **Classification**: Dissociative Anesthetic (NMDA receptor antagonist)
- **Duration**: 4-8 hours (effects can persist longer)
- **Onset**: 15-60 minutes (depending on route)
- **Peak**: 1-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-6 hours
- **Origin**: Synthetic (developed as anesthetic)
- **Legal Status**: Schedule II (medical use) / Schedule I (recreational)

## Experience
*PCP produces profound dissociation from body and environment, often with unpredictable and potentially dangerous effects. Users may experience anesthesia, altered reality perception, and possible aggressive or erratic behavior that they cannot control or remember.*

### Set and Setting Considerations
- **EXTREME CAUTION: Highly unpredictable and potentially dangerous**
- Safe, controlled environment absolutely essential
- Medical supervision advisable due to serious risks
- Remove dangerous objects and potential hazards
- Experienced supervision necessary

### Typical Experience Phases
- **Onset** (15-60 minutes): Initial dissociation and reality changes
- **Peak** (1-4 hours): Full dissociative effects, possible loss of control
- **Plateau** (1-3 hours): Sustained altered state
- **Come Down** (2-6 hours): Gradual return with possible lingering effects

- Do not attempt to restrain or confront someone on PCP

## Therapeutic Use

### Clinical Research
- Limited research due to extreme safety concerns
- Historical research into anesthetic properties
- Studies documenting dangerous effects and toxicity
- Research into NMDA receptor mechanisms

### Therapeutic Applications
- **NO CURRENT THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS**
- Historical use as anesthetic (discontinued due to side effects)
- Research into dissociative mechanisms
- No legitimate psychiatric or psychological uses

### Current Studies
- Limited to safety and toxicology research
- Studies documenting adverse effects
- Research into detection and treatment methods
- No beneficial therapeutic research

### Medical Supervision
- Only legitimate use is emergency medical treatment of intoxication
- Hospital treatment for PCP intoxication and complications
- No supervised therapeutic protocols exist
- Medical community strongly advises complete avoidance

## Personal Growth

### Introspective Qualities
- **NOT SUITABLE FOR PERSONAL GROWTH**

- Legal and social complications common

## Microdosing

### Definition and Protocol
- **ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMENDED**
- No safe microdosing protocol exists
- Even small amounts can be unpredictable and dangerous
- No established therapeutic window

### Reported Benefits
- None - only serious risks reported

### Dosing Guidelines
- **NO SAFE DOSE EXISTS FOR RECREATIONAL USE**
- Medical use requires precise pharmaceutical preparations
- Street PCP impossible to dose safely

### Considerations
- Extremely dangerous at any dose level
- No predictable or safe effects
- Vastly safer alternatives exist for any desired benefits

## Legality

### Global Legal Status
- Schedule II (medical) / Schedule I (recreational) in most countries
- Illegal for recreational use worldwide
