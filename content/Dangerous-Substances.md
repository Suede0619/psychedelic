## Overview

Certain psychoactive substances carry extreme risks that far outweigh any potential benefits. These substances are characterized by unpredictable effects, high toxicity, multiple documented fatalities, and lack of therapeutic benefit. Understanding these risks is crucial for harm reduction and public safety.

## Extremely Dangerous Substances

### NBOMe Compounds
*Highly dangerous psychedelic imposters*

Synthetic compounds that have caused multiple deaths due to extremely narrow safety margins and frequent misrepresentation as safer substances.

**Extreme Danger Profile:**
- Fatal doses as low as 1-2mg
- Often sold deceptively as LSD on blotter paper
- Causes seizures, hyperthermia, and cardiovascular collapse
- Bitter metallic taste distinguishes from tasteless LSD
- Emergency scheduled due to multiple deaths

### Anticholinergic Deliriants
*Tropane alkaloid-containing plants*

Plant-based substances causing complete delirium and loss of reality testing, with unpredictable and potentially fatal effects.

**Extreme Danger Profile:**
- Impossible to determine safe dosing
- Complete loss of reality testing for 12-48+ hours
- Realistic hallucinations indistinguishable from reality
- High risk of accidents, self-harm, and dangerous behavior
- Potential for fatal anticholinergic poisoning

### Dangerous Dissociatives
*Unpredictable and high-risk compounds*

Dissociative substances with unpredictable behavioral effects and high potential for violence and injury.

**High Danger Profile:**
- Extremely unpredictable behavioral effects
- High risk of violence and self-injury
- Anesthetic effects mask pain, leading to severe injuries
- Potential for prolonged psychotic episodes
- High risk of violence and self-injury
- Anesthetic effects mask pain, leading to severe injuries

- No way to predict safe dosing for individuals
- Tolerance does not prevent fatal overdose

### Unpredictable Effects
- Effects vary wildly between individuals and sessions
- No way to predict or control experience
- High risk of panic, violence, and dangerous behavior
- Complete loss of judgment and reality testing

### Medical Emergency Risks
- Seizures and convulsions
- Hyperthermia (dangerous overheating)
- Cardiovascular collapse
- Respiratory depression
- Anticholinergic toxicity

### Psychological Dangers
- Complete psychotic breaks
- Realistic hallucinations indistinguishable from reality
- Paranoia and violent behavior
- Self-harm and suicidal ideation
- Long-term psychological damage

## Harm Identification and Response

### Recognition of Dangerous Substances

**NBOMe Warning Signs:**
- Bitter, metallic taste (LSD is tasteless)
- Tongue and mouth numbing
- Sold as "LSD" but causes physical effects
- Comes on blotter paper but isn't LSD

**Datura Warning Signs:**
- Plant material or seeds offered as "natural psychedelic"
- Claims of "spiritual" or "shamanic" use
- Realistic hallucinations (spiders, people, conversations)
- Complete inability to recognize unreality

**PCP Warning Signs:**
- Extreme dissociation with violent potential
- Anesthetic effects (no pain response)
- Bizarre, unpredictable behavior
- Superhuman strength perception

### Emergency Response

**Immediate Actions:**
- Call emergency services immediately (911/emergency number)
- Do not attempt to restrain violently unless trained
- Protect from self-harm and environmental dangers
- Provide supportive care and monitoring
- Stay with person until medical help arrives

**Medical Information for First Responders:**
- Provide substance name if known
- Describe symptoms and timeline
- Mention any other substances used
- Provide dosage information if available

---

## Substance Substitution and Testing

### Avoiding Dangerous Substitutes

**LSD vs NBOMe:**
- Real LSD has no taste and doesn't numb tongue
- NBOMe has bitter, metallic taste and numbs mouth
- Test with Ehrlich reagent (LSD turns purple, NBOMe doesn't)
- If it's bitter, it's a spitter (reject it)

**Testing Methods:**
- Always use reagent testing kits
- Multiple tests may be needed for identification
- Laboratory analysis when possible
- Never assume substance identity without testing

### Safer Alternatives
- Well-researched classical psychedelics
- Substances with established safety profiles
- Legal therapeutic options where available
- Clinical trial participation
