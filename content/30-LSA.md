## Overview
*LSA is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in morning glory seeds and Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. As a precursor to LSD, it produces similar but generally milder effects with more body load and nausea, offering a natural lysergamide experience.*

- **Chemical Name**: Lysergic acid amide (ergine)
- **Common Names**: LSA, Ergine, Morning Glory, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, HBWR
- **Classification**: Natural Lysergamide Psychedelic (5-HT2A receptor agonist)
- **Duration**: 6-12 hours
- **Onset**: 30-120 minutes
- **Peak**: 3-6 hours
- **Come Down**: 3-6 hours
- **Origin**: Natural (morning glory and Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds)
- **Legal Status**: Seeds legal in most places, LSA compound scheduling varies

## Experience
*LSA produces psychedelic effects similar to LSD but with more body load, nausea, and generally milder psychological effects. The experience often includes introspection, visual effects, and spiritual insights, though physical discomfort is common.*
