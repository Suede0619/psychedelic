# Phenethylamines

*Phenethylamine backbone psychedelics with methoxy substitutions, often more stimulating with colorful visuals*

## Overview

Phenethylamines are a diverse class of psychedelic compounds based on the phenethylamine chemical structure. They are characterized by their stimulating effects, colorful and geometric visual patterns, and often empathogenic qualities. This class includes both natural compounds like mescaline and synthetic creations from chemists like Alexander Shulgin.

## Chemical Structure and Properties

### Core Structure
**Phenethylamine Backbone:**
- Benzene ring connected to ethylamine chain
- Methoxy substitutions create psychedelic activity
- Various positions of substitution (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Alpha-methyl groups increase potency and duration
- Generally more stimulating than tryptamines

### Structure-Activity Relationships
**Key Modifications:**
- 2,5-dimethoxy substitution (common pattern)
- 4-position substitutions (bromo, chloro, iodo)
- Alpha-methyl groups (amphetamine derivatives)
- N-substitutions (affecting duration and effects)
 - Ring substitutions creating novel effects

## Pharmacology and Mechanisms

### Receptor Activity
**Primary Mechanisms:**
- 5-HT2A receptor agonism (psychedelic effects)
- 5-HT2C receptor activity (mood and appetite)
- Alpha-adrenergic receptor activity (stimulation)
- Dopamine receptor interactions (some compounds)
- Norepinephrine transporter effects (stimulation)

### Unique Pharmacological Properties
**Stimulating Characteristics:**
- Increased heart rate and blood pressure
- Enhanced alertness and energy
- Reduced appetite
- Increased body temperature
- Potential for vasoconstriction

### Duration and Metabolism
**Pharmacokinetics:**
- Generally longer duration than tryptamines
- Hepatic metabolism via multiple pathways
- MAO resistance (compared to tryptamines)
- Variable elimination rates
- Dose-dependent duration effects
