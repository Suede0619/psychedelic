## Overview
*Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that has gained recognition as a breakthrough treatment for depression. Originally developed for medical anesthesia, it's now used both therapeutically for mental health conditions and recreationally for its unique consciousness-altering effects.*

- **Chemical Name**: Ketamine Hydrochloride (2-(2-Chlorophenyl)-2-(methylamino)cyclohexanone)
- **Common Names**: Ketamine, Special K, K, Ket, Vitamin K, Cat Tranquilizer
- **Classification**: Dissociative Anesthetic (NMDA receptor antagonist)
- **Duration**: 45-90 minutes (intramuscular), 1-2 hours (oral)
- **Onset**: 2-5 minutes (IV), 5-15 minutes (IM), 15-30 minutes (oral)
- **Peak**: 10-30 minutes (IV/IM), 30-60 minutes (oral)
- **Come Down**: 30-60 minutes
- **Origin**: Synthetic (developed 1962)
- **Legal Status**: Schedule III (controlled but legal for medical use)

## Experience
*Ketamine produces a unique dissociative state characterized by feelings of detachment from the body and environment. At higher doses, users may experience the "K-hole" - a state of complete ego dissolution and out-of-body experiences.*

### Set and Setting Considerations
- Safe, comfortable environment essential due to motor impairment
- Medical supervision recommended for therapeutic use
- Avoid standing or moving during effects
- Quiet, peaceful setting optimal for introspective work

### Typical Experience Phases
- **Onset** (2-30 minutes): Initial dissociative feelings, body numbness
- **Peak** (10-60 minutes): Full dissociation, possible K-hole experience
- **Plateau** (15-45 minutes): Sustained effects with gradual lessening
- **Come Down** (30-60 minutes): Gradual return to normal consciousness
