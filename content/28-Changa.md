## Overview
*Changa is a smokable herbal blend containing DMT and MAOI-containing plants, creating a more gradual and extended DMT experience. Often called "smokable ayahuasca," it combines the visual intensity of DMT with the extended duration and deeper integration time of ayahuasca.*

- **Chemical Name**: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors in herbal matrix
- **Common Names**: Changa, Enhanced Leaf, Smokable Ayahuasca
- **Classification**: Plant Medicine Combination (DMT + MAOI)
- **Duration**: 15-60 minutes (extended from pure DMT)
- **Onset**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes
- **Peak**: 5-20 minutes
- **Come Down**: 10-40 minutes
- **Origin**: Modern creation (traditional plant combinations)
- **Legal Status**: Illegal in most countries (due to DMT content)
