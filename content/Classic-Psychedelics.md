# Classic Psychedelics (Serotonergic)

*Primary mechanism: 5-HT2A receptor agonism leading to altered consciousness and perception*

## Overview

Classic psychedelics are compounds that primarily work through serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism, producing characteristic alterations in perception, consciousness, and cognition. These substances are distinguished by their ability to produce visual and auditory hallucinations, spiritual experiences, and profound shifts in awareness.

## Chemical Classifications

### [[Tryptamines]]
*Indole ring system with ethylamine side chain*
- Chemical structure based on tryptamine backbone
- Often produce introspective and spiritual experiences
- Duration typically 4-8 hours
- Visual effects tend to be organic and flowing

### [[Lysergamides]]
*Ergot alkaloid derivatives*
- Chemical structure based on lysergic acid
- Known for long duration (8-12+ hours)
- Profound consciousness alteration
- Often described as more analytical and clear-headed

### [[Phenethylamines]]
*Phenethylamine backbone with methoxy substitutions*
- Chemical structure based on phenethylamine
- Often more stimulating than other classes
- Colorful and geometric visual effects
- May have empathogenic qualities

## Therapeutic Mechanisms

### Neuroplasticity Enhancement
- Increased BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
- Dendritic spine growth and synaptic plasticity
- Enhanced neural connectivity
- Neurogenesis promotion

### Default Mode Network Disruption
- Reduced activity in default mode network
- Decreased self-referential thinking
- Enhanced connectivity between brain regions
- Ego dissolution and unity experiences

### Serotonin System Modulation
- 5-HT2A receptor activation
- Downstream effects on neurotransmitter systems
- Enhanced emotional processing
- Improved mood regulation

## Safety Considerations

### Physical Safety
- Generally low physical toxicity
- Cardiovascular considerations at high doses
- Interaction with certain medications
- Importance of proper dosing

### Psychological Safety
- Risk of challenging or difficult experiences
- Importance of set and setting
- Contraindications for certain mental health conditions
- Need for integration support

### Legal Considerations
- Most classic psychedelics are Schedule I substances
- Growing medical research exemptions
- Varying legal status by jurisdiction
- Emerging decriminalization efforts
