# Lysergamides

*Ergot alkaloid derivatives known for long duration and profound consciousness alteration*

## Overview

Lysergamides are a class of psychedelic compounds derived from lysergic acid, originally found in ergot fungi. These substances are characterized by their exceptionally long duration (8-12+ hours), profound alterations in consciousness, and unique analytical/introspective qualities. LSD remains the archetypal compound in this class.
