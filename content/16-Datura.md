## Overview
*Datura is a highly toxic plant containing tropane alkaloids that produce powerful and dangerous deliriant effects. Unlike classical psychedelics, datura creates realistic but terrifying hallucinations and is associated with serious medical risks and psychological trauma.*

- **Chemical Name**: Datura stramonium (containing scopolamine, atropine, hyoscyamine)
- **Common Names**: Datura, Jimsonweed, Devil's Trumpet, Thorn Apple, Mad Hatter
- **Classification**: Deliriant/Anticholinergic (NOT a classical psychedelic)
- **Duration**: 12-48 hours (extremely variable and unpredictable)
- **Onset**: 30-120 minutes
- **Peak**: 4-16 hours
- **Come Down**: 8-24 hours
- **Origin**: Natural (found worldwide)
- **Legal Status**: Legal to grow in most places, dangerous to consume

## Experience
*Datura produces realistic but terrifying hallucinations, complete delirium, and dangerous loss of contact with reality. Users often cannot distinguish hallucinations from reality and may engage in dangerous behaviors. This is NOT a recreational substance and carries extreme risks.*

### Set and Setting Considerations
- **WARNING: Datura is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal**
- Should never be consumed recreationally

- Extremely high risk of serious injury or death

### Typical Experience Phases
- **Onset** (30-120 minutes): Initial disorientation, dry mouth, blurred vision
- **Delirium** (4-16 hours): Complete loss of reality, terrifying hallucinations
