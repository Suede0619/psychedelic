## Overview
*3-MeO-PCP is a synthetic dissociative drug related to PCP but with a more manageable and less dangerous profile. Known for producing clear-headed dissociation, enhanced creativity, and therapeutic-like effects at appropriate doses, though it still carries significant risks.*

- **Chemical Name**: 3-Methoxyphencyclidine
- **Common Names**: 3-MeO-PCP, 3-Methoxy-PCP
- **Classification**: Dissociative (NMDA receptor antagonist)
- **Duration**: 4-8 hours
- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes (oral), 15-30 minutes (other routes)
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-6 hours
- **Origin**: Synthetic (PCP analogue)
- **Legal Status**: Legal grey area in many jurisdictions

## Experience
*3-MeO-PCP produces dissociation with maintained cognitive clarity, enhanced creativity, and possible therapeutic insights. At appropriate doses, it offers the benefits of dissociation without the extreme unpredictability and dangers associated with PCP.*
