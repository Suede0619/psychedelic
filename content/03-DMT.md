## Experience
*DMT experiences are characterized by their intensity and otherworldly nature. Users often report encounters with entities, travel to alien landscapes, and complete dissolution of ordinary reality.*

### Set and Setting Considerations
- Safe, comfortable environment with experienced sitter
- Lying down position recommended due to intensity
- Quiet environment to focus on internal experience
- Trust in the process essential due to rapid onset

### Typical Experience Phases
- **Onset** (0-2 minutes): Immediate reality dissolution, geometric patterns
- **Peak** (2-15 minutes): Entity encounters, impossible geometries, ego death
- **Plateau** (5-10 minutes): Sustained otherworldly experiences
