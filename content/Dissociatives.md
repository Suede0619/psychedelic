# Dissociatives

*Substances that cause disconnection between mind and body, altered sense of identity*

## Overview

Dissociatives are a class of psychoactive substances that produce a sense of disconnection or dissociation from one's body, environment, and identity. Unlike classic psychedelics that work through serotonin receptors, dissociatives primarily work as NMDA receptor antagonists, blocking glutamate neurotransmission and creating unique altered states of consciousness.

## Mechanism of Action

### NMDA Receptor Antagonism
- **Glutamate Blockade**: Interruption of primary excitatory neurotransmitter
- **Ketamine Receptor**: Primary target for most dissociatives
- **Anesthetic Effects**: Loss of sensation and awareness
- **Antidepressant Action**: Rapid-acting mood improvement

### Neurobiological Effects
- Disruption of cortical-subcortical circuits
- Enhanced neuroplasticity and BDNF expression
- Altered default mode network activity
- Changes in brain connectivity patterns

## Classifications

### Arylcyclohexylamines
*PCP and ketamine-related compounds*

Medical and research compounds that work through NMDA receptor antagonism, representing both therapeutic breakthroughs and dangerous substances requiring careful distinction.

**Key Characteristics:**
- NMDA receptor antagonism mechanism
- Anesthetic and dissociative effects
- Therapeutic applications (ketamine) vs high-risk profiles (PCP analogs)
- Variable duration and safety profiles

### Unique Mechanisms

Dissociative substances working through alternative receptor systems, creating distinct experiential profiles.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Kappa-opioid receptor agonism (salvia)
- Very short duration experiences
- Intense and often challenging effects
- Limited therapeutic research

### Inhalants

Brief-acting dissociative gases with medical applications and emerging therapeutic research.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Medical anesthetic applications
- Very short duration (minutes)
- Generally safe when used appropriately
- Emerging depression treatment research

- **Efficacy**: Effective when other treatments have failed

### Chronic Pain Management
- Ketamine infusions for chronic pain conditions
- Interruption of pain signaling pathways
- Treatment of fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain
- Alternative to opioid medications

### Addiction Treatment
- Potential for treating alcohol and drug addiction
- Disruption of addictive behavior patterns
- Enhanced psychotherapy for addiction
- Research stage for most applications

### PTSD and Trauma
- Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for trauma
- Reduced fear response and emotional numbing
- Enhanced processing of traumatic memories
- Integration with trauma-focused therapy

## Medical Use and Protocols

### Ketamine Treatment Protocols

**IV Infusion Therapy**
- Medical supervision required
- Series of treatments over several weeks
- Monitoring of vital signs and mental status
- Integration with psychotherapy when appropriate

**Spravato (Esketamine) Nasal Spray**
- Administered in clinical settings
- Observation period required after administration
- Combination with oral antidepressants
- Regular monitoring and assessment

### Clinical Settings
- Specialized ketamine clinics
- Hospital and medical center programs
- Integration with psychiatric care
- Trained medical professionals required

---

## Safety Considerations

### Medical Risks
- Cardiovascular effects (increased heart rate and blood pressure)
- Respiratory depression at high doses
- Bladder and urinary tract damage with chronic use
- Cognitive impairment with frequent use
- Potential for psychological dependence

### Psychological Risks
- Risk of psychotic or manic episodes
- Challenging or frightening experiences
- Dissociation-induced anxiety or panic
- Memory impairment and confusion
- Risk of accidents due to impaired coordination

### Contraindications
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- History of psychosis or severe mental illness
- Active substance abuse
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Certain heart conditions

---

## Harm Reduction

### Safe Use Practices
- Medical supervision when possible
- Start with low doses to assess sensitivity
- Safe, comfortable environment
- Trusted, sober support person present
- Avoid mixing with other substances

### Emergency Preparedness
- Access to medical care if needed
- Recognition of overdose symptoms
- Understanding of contraindications
- Awareness of medication interactions
- Integration support after use

---

## Research and Development

### Current Research
- Optimization of ketamine treatment protocols
- Development of new dissociative medications
- Research into mechanism of antidepressant action
- Studies of neuroplasticity enhancement
- Investigation of addiction treatment applications

### Future Directions
- Personalized medicine approaches
- Combination with psychotherapy protocols
- Development of longer-acting formulations
- Research into other psychiatric conditions
- Investigation of neuroprotective effects

---

## Legal Status

### Medical Use
- Ketamine: Legal for medical use, controlled substance
- Nitrous oxide: Legal for medical and dental use
- Clinical research exemptions for other compounds

### Recreational Use
- Most dissociatives are controlled substances
- Significant legal penalties for non-medical use
- Research chemicals may exist in legal grey areas
- Laws vary by jurisdiction
