## Overview
*Harmaline is a beta-carboline alkaloid found in various plants including Banisteriopsis caapi and Peganum harmala. As an MAOI and mild psychoactive compound, it enables oral DMT activity and produces its own unique consciousness-altering effects including enhanced dreams and spiritual experiences.*

- **Chemical Name**: 7-Methoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydro-Î²-carboline
- **Common Names**: Harmaline, Telepathine, Banisterine, Yageine
- **Classification**: Beta-carboline MAOI with Mild Psychoactive Properties
- **Duration**: 4-8 hours
- **Onset**: 30-90 minutes
- **Peak**: 2-4 hours
- **Come Down**: 2-4 hours
- **Origin**: Natural (found in Banisteriopsis caapi, Peganum harmala, others)
- **Legal Status**: Legal in most jurisdictions as isolated compound

## Experience
*Harmaline produces subtle but distinct consciousness alterations including enhanced dreams, mild visual effects, and spiritual/introspective states. It's primarily used as an MAOI to potentiate other tryptamines, but has its own unique psychoactive properties.*
